# credit-card-fraud-detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques. Credit card fraud detection is a classic imbalanced classification problem, where fraudulent transactions form a very small fraction of total transactions. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify fraud while minimizing false negatives.

This project deals with:

Data preprocessing

Handling imbalanced datasets

Model training and evaluation

Practical ML problem-solving
